Higher-level programming refers to a style of computer programming that focuses on abstracting and simplifying the complexities of low-level hardware and software details. In higher-level programming languages, developers work with more user-friendly and human-readable code, allowing them to express their intentions in a way that is closer to natural language. Here's a description of higher-level programming:

Higher-level programming is a programming paradigm that empowers developers to create software applications with a strong emphasis on readability, simplicity, and abstraction. In contrast to lower-level languages like assembly or machine code, which interact directly with hardware and require a deep understanding of computer architecture, higher-level programming languages provide a more user-friendly and efficient way to write code.
