python object relational mapping
0. Get all states
Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported

1. Filter states

3. SQL Injection...
Wait, do you remember the previous task? Did you test "Arizona'; TRUNCATE TABLE states ; SELECT * FROM states WHERE name = '" as an input?
What? Empty?

Yes, it’s an SQL injection to delete all records of a table…

Once again, write a script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument. But this time, write one that is safe from MySQL injections!
