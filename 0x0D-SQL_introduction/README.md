SQL introduction
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, enabling users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data. SQL is used by database management systems (DBMS) to perform these operations.

Key features of SQL include:

Data Query Language (DQL):

SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
Data Definition Language (DDL):

CREATE: Creates database objects such as tables, indexes, or views.
ALTER: Modifies the structure of existing database objects.
DROP: Deletes database objects.
Data Manipulation Language (DML):

INSERT: Adds new records to a table.
UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.
DELETE: Removes records from a table.
Data Control Language (DCL):

GRANT: Provides specific privileges to users or roles.
REVOKE: Removes specific privileges from users or roles.
Transaction Control Language (TCL):

COMMIT: Saves changes made during the current transaction.
ROLLBACK: Reverts changes made during the current transaction.
SAVEPOINT: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
SQL is widely used in conjunction with relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and SQLite. These systems implement and extend the SQL standard to provide additional features, optimizations, and capabilities.
